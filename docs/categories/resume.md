Professional Summary:

TLDR; After working as an Infrastructure, DevOps, and Cloud Engineer, I've transitioned into a Cloud Architect role focusing on Azure. My operational years have given me extensive experience with Microsoft technologies like M365, Dynamics, SharePoint, Active Directory, and Securityâ€”mostly through my time in consulting. Having supported over 30-40 customers, I've gained experience that's rare even within the consulting space.
